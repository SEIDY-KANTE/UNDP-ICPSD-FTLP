Objective:
Build a Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user and provides a health assessment based on their BMI value.

Background Context: BMI is a measure used to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for a person of their height. It is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight in kilograms / height in meters^2

The BMI categories are:
• Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
• Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
• Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
• Obesity: BMI is 30 or greater

Tasks:

User Input:
• Prompt the user to input their weight in kilograms (float).
• Prompt the user to input their height in meters (float).

Calculate BMI:
Using the formula provided, calculate the BMI. Store it in a variable named bmi.

Provide Health Assessment:
Using conditional statements (if, elif, and else), determine which BMI category the user falls into. Print out the user's BMI and the corresponding health assessment.

Error Handling (Optional):
Ensure the user cannot enter a negative or zero value for height or weight. If they do, provide an error message and prompt them to enter the value again.

Expected Output:
Enter your weight in kilograms: 70 Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Your BMI is 22.86. You have a Normal weight.
